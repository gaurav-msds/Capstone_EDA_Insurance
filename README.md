### Insurance Price Predictor
**Author** Gaurav Garg

#### Executive summary
The insurance industry is no stranger to data driven decision making. Yet in today's rapidly transforming digital landscape, Insurance is struggling to adapt and benefit from new technologies compared to other industries. Extremely complex underwriting rule-sets that are radically different in different product lines, lack of a centralized customer information base, complex relationship with consumers in traditional risk underwriting where sometimes customer centricity runs reverse to business profit, inertia of regulatory compliance - are some of the unique challenges faced by Insurance Business.

This dataset can be helpful in a simple yet illuminating study in understanding the risk underwriting in Health Insurance, the interplay of various attributes of the insured and see how they affect the insurance premium.

#### Rationale
Developed countries face demographic challenges primarily due to population aging and declining birth rates, leading to smaller workforces and a growing dependency ratio. These shifts can strain public finances, particularly for pensions and healthcare, and may impact economic growth. Hence, trying to get an accurate model to help plan for medical expenses is extremely important to maintain financial health and well-being of an economy.

#### Research Question
What are the key factors that impact an individual's insurance? Is it age or lifestyle or something else?

#### Data Sources

#### Methodology
The initial method for baseline model is a simple Linear Regression Model.

#### Results
The preliminary results indicate a linear relationship for insurance rates below $15,000. 
- If an individual is a Smoker, the charges increases by 1387.91 regardless of other features.
- The charges increases by 273.81 with every unit increase in Age while other values remain constant.

#### Next steps
Advanced Modelling techniques and other regression models that will help provide a better range and minimize the prediction error will be deployed in the next subsequent weeks.
